#   feature make sure that the docker daemon is running locally and has its
#   unix socket published at unix://var/run/docker.sock. Also make sure that
#   the docker image selenium/standalone-firefox is available.
# * saucelabs: makes robottelo run tests on SauceLabs. The saucelabs_user and
#   saucelabs_key are required and the browser used is the same specified on
#   webdriver.  Supported values for webdriver are firefox, chrome and ie, the
#   other valid webdriver values are going to be translated to firefox.
# * remote: to access the remote browser, the webdriver and command_executor
#   are required.
