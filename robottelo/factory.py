"""Base classes for creating factories.

Factories serve as a fixtures replacement. Rather than creating an exhaustive,
static set of entities on a Foreman deployment and writing tests that use those
entities, factories allow tests to create minimal sets of objects when they're
actually needed: when each individual test is run.

This module provides the base classes needed to implement factories. The
classes in this module are useless by themselves. For information on how to use
the base classes, read the docstrings on the classes themselves. For examples
of factory implementations, see :mod:`robottelo.entities`.
