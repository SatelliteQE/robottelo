"""
This module contains tests both for Foreman and Robottelo itself.

Tests for Robottelo are in the ``robottelo`` module. Those tests are
inward-facing: they help ensure that this codebase is functioning correctly.

Tests for Foreman are in the ``foreman`` module. Those tests are
outward-facing: they help ensure that a Foreman deployment is functioning
correctly.
