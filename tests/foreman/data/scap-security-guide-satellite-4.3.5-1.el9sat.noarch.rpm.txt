This is an artificially built SCAP content for testing purposes. It is intentionally an rpm with big version (even bigger than the other scap content rpm) so it can be used for a long time (and updates the other rpm). This content contains one policy "ANSSI-BP-028 (enhanced)" and within it one test "Set Password Minimum Length in FISH" applicable to RHEL9. The only purpose of this file is to check the difference between the uploaded SCAP contents by checking for presence of "FISH".
