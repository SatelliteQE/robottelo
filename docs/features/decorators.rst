Decorators
==========

This section explains Robottello decorators.

Modules
-------

Robottelo decorators are located under
:doc:`decorator package </api/robottelo.decorators>`. Most of them are used to
control if a test must be skipped or executed accordingly with specific
configurations.

stubbed
-------

``stubbed`` skips any test it decorates. A reason can be provided as parameter
and its default is "Not Implemented". Most of times it is used to define all
manual (not automated) tests related to a feature. Example::

    from robottelo.decorators import stubbed

    @stubbed()
    def test_negative_create_matcher_attribute_priority(self):
        """Test will be implemented later"""

    @stubbed('Some other reason than not implemented')
    def test_positive_create_matcher_attribute_priority(self):
        """Test will be implemented later"""

skip_if_bug_open
----------------

``skip_if_bug_open`` skips test based on bug tracker status. Currently Bugzilla
and Redmine are supported. The decorator receives two parameters. The first
indicates the tracker and must be one of 'bugzilla' or 'redmine'. The second
parameter indicates the bug id on respective bug tracker. Example::

    from robottelo.decorators import skip_if_bug_open

    @skip_if_bug_open('bugzilla', 1297308)
    def test_negative_add_puppet_content(self):
        """Attempt to associate puppet repos within a custom content
        view directly
        """

    @skip_if_bug_open('redmine', 23456789)
    def test_positive_add_puppet_content(self):
        """Attempt to associate puppet repos within a custom content
        view directly
        """

Decorator communicates with bug tracker to know the status of respective bug
id. If it is still open, test will be skipped. Once bz is fixed and moved to
ON_QA or Verified state, test will automatically be run with next builds.

This is useful to allow QE team automating test cases even before a bug is
fixed or a feature is implemented, while test will not be considered a build
fail until the issue has it state changed.

skip_if_os
----------

``skip_if_os`` skips test based on Foreman/Satellite host os version. It
communicates with host defined on ``robottello.properties`` to get its os
version. Currently it checks only Red Hat Enterprise Linux versions. Example::

    from robottelo.decorators.host import skip_if_os

    @skip_if_os('RHEL6')
    def test_positive_create_custom_ostree_repo(self):
        """Create Custom ostree repository"""

    @skip_if_os('RHEL6', 'RHEL5')
    def test_negative_create_custom_ostree_repo(self):
        """Create Custom ostree repository"""

The first test will be skipped if host os is RHEL6.x.y, where x and y can be
any number. If ``RHEL6.1`` was used as parameter it would skip for any
RHEL6.1.z version and so on.

Arbitrary number versions can be passed as parameters. On second test both RHEL
5 and 6 families would be skipped.

This decorator is used to avoid false failures when an feature is supported
only on one os version. For example, ostree repository is available
in RHEL7 but not in RHEL6.
