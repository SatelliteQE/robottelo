Reviewing PRs
=============

Ensure commits are squashed.

Thoroughly review each change for errors or departures from the **Robottelo**
:doc:`code standards </code_standards>`.

If you note something that should be changed, or want clarification, add a
comment to the line of code or the PR as a whole.

If tests were added, ensure the PR includes the results or simply a message
stating *"All tests passed."* or *"Unable to run tests at this time due to
_____."*

**Don't merge** unless there have been two ACKs.

**Don't merge** unless the PR passes the Travis CI build.

Once all the above criteria have been met, and the author has completed all
changes, then you may merge.


ToDo

Elaborate on the process.
